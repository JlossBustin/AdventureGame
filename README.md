### Description:
AdventureGame was intended to be a project that would provide the group with crash-course knowledge of C++, as in learning vectors, inputting & outputting information, using multiple functions and method calls to give the project functionality, and syntax in the form of a classic text-based adventure game.

*Pulled from source code description*:
"The project will prompt the user for their name, store their name in a string variable and begin a text-based adventure. The user has full control over what paths they want to take through the inputting of integer values, which are read in through the program and direct the player to different rooms. This leads to completely different opportunities for play-throughs."
